<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Bootstrapping</h1>
</div>
<p>When you press F5, you see pacman eating dots.</p>
<p>
  This is a gif, located in the assets folder.<br />
  You see it because Angular has not yet been loaded and this image is used as a<br />
  placeholder in the &lt;app-root&gt; element of index.html.<br />
  The Angular application will replace it's contents with the component bootstrapped<br />
  in the root module. That module is defined in main.ts.<br />
  To make it a bit slower, I have added a timeout of 1 second. <br />
  After the app is loaded, you get <a href="/examples/bootstrapping/start">this</a> (but a little bit different).
